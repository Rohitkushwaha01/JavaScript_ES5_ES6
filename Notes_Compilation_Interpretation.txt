js is a High-level prototype-based object oriented multi-paradigm interpreted or just in-time complied dynamic single-threaded garbage-collection progarmming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

# js-engine = js-engine is a program that executes js code.
# JavaScript is a multi-paradigm prototype-based language, which uses JavaScript Engine such as Chromeâ€™s V8 engine Firefox SpiderMonkey engine and etc. They convert the high level code into machine-readable code which lets computer to perform some specific tasks.

# compilation, interpretation and just-in-time compilation

# Every computers understand only machine code and hence we need to convert our program into the machine code which is done using js engine.

# compilation : In compilation, entire source code is converted into machine code at once and this machine code is written in a protable file/binary file that can be executed by a computer.

# source code ---->compilation---> protable file/machine code ----> execution ----> program running

# The execution happens way after compilation.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

# Interpretation: interpreter runs throught the source code and executes it line by line.

# source code ----> execution line by line ----> program running

# interpretation is much slower, this is okay before but now low peroformace is no longer acceptable.

# so we use just-in-time compilation

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

# just-in-time compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately.

# the execution happens immediately after compilation. so here we don't have a protable file.

# source code ---->compilation---> no protable file/machine code ----> execution ----> program running

// compilation and interpretation on javascript

# As the code enters the js-engine the first step is to parse the code which means to read the code. The code is parsed into a abstract data structure tree or AST. 

# AST is nothing to do with DOM TREE.

# Now the generated AST is converted into a machine code with the help of compilation.

# Then this machine code is executed immediately as js follows just-in-time compilation.

# first js-engine generate a  very unoptimized code as to make a program run and then in the background this code is being optimized and recomplied during the already running program execution and this can be done multiple times and after each optimization and unoptimized code is simply swapped with the optimized code  without stopping the code execution.

# This all optimization is happens is some special threads that we can't access from the code.
